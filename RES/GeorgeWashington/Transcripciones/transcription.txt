271-05 You are hereby ordered to repair to 
271-06 Captain Hogg's Company at Fort Dinwiddie 
271-07 with eight good mens: as that Company is

271-29 list by the 1st. of December. Your late disobedi - 
271-30 ence of Orders has greatly displeased me. It is 
271-31 impofsible to carry on affairs as they ought to be 
271-32 when you pay so little regard to the Force of a 
271-33 Military Order  - You must be conscious within

300-16 I have sent the Bearer Cap - 
300-17 tain John Mercer (who has accompts to 
300-18 settle with the Committee to the Treasu - 
300-19 rer for the balance of that ten thousand 
300-20 pounds; and to aquaint your Honour 
300-21 that meeting with Letters at Fredericks - 
300-22 burgh as I returned from Williamsburgh 
300-23 informing me that all was peaceable 
300-24 above and that nothing was so imme - 
300-25 diately wanting as Salt. I got what I 
300-26 could at that place and hastened on 
300-27 here to engage more;  - to receive the Recruits 
300-28 that were expected in; and to wait the ar - 
300-29 rival of the Vefsel with arms etc. from James 
300-30 River in order to forward them up with 
300-31 the greater dispatch. The Vefsel is not yet 
300-32 arrived.  - 
300-33 I have impatiently expected 
300-34 to hear the result of you Honours Letter 
300-35 to General Shirley; and with that the de - 
301-03 Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755. 
301-05 lays may not prove ominous. In that case I 
301-06 shall not know how to act; for I can never 
301-07 submit to the command of Captain Dag - 
301-08 morthy since you have honoured me with 
301-09 the Command of the Virginia Regiment 
301-10 etc. The Country has sustained inconceivable 
301-11 lofses by delaying the Commifsaries at Williamsburghs: 
301-12 many of the Carolina Beeves are dead through ab - 
301-13 solute poverty; and the chief part of them too poor 
301-14 to slaughter. We are at a lofs how to act for want 
301-15 of the mutiny Bill; and should be obliged to 
301-16 your Honour to have fifty or an hundred printed 
301-17 and sent by the Bearer. There is a clause in 
301-18 that Bill which if you are not kind enough 
301-19 to obviate will prevent entirely the good inten - 
301-20 tion of its: i.e. delaying the execution of Sen - 
301-21 tences until your Honour shall be made ac - 
301-22 quainted with the proceedings of the Court. 
301-23 This at times when there is the great - 
301-24 est occasion for Expamples will be morally im - 
301-25 pofsible (I mean while we are on our march; 
301-26 perhaps near the Ohio) when none but strong par - 
301-27 ties can pafs with safetys: at all times it must be 
301-28 attended with great expence trouble and inconve - 
301-29 niency. this I represented to Colonel Corbin and 
301-30 some other Gentlemen of the Council when I 
301-31 was down; who said that that objection to 
301-32 the Bill would be removed by your Hon - 
301-33 ours giving Blank Warrants to be filled up 
301-34 as occasion should require. This would effec - 
301-35 tually remedy all those Evils and put things 
301-36 in their proper channel. 
301-37 We suffer greatly for want of Ket - 
302-01 302. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755. 
302-03 Kettless: those sent from below being Tin are of 
302-04 small duration. We shall also in a little time 
302-05 suffer as much for want of Clothing; none 
302-06 can be got in these partss: those which Major 
302-07 Carlyle and Dalton contracted to furnish 
302-08 we are disappointed off. Shoes and Stockings 
302-09 we have and can get more if wanted but 
302-10 nothing else. I should be glad your Honor 
302-11 would direct what is to be done in these ca - 
302-12 ses; and that you would be kind enough to 
302-13 desire the Treasurer to send some part of the 
302-14 money in gold and silvers: were this done we 
302-15 might often get necefsaries for the Regiment 
302-16 in Maryland or Pennsylvania when they 
302-17 can not be had here. but with our money 
302-18 it is is impofsible; our paper not pafsing there. 
302-19 The recruiting Service goes on ex - 
302-20 tremely slow. Yesterday being a day appointed 
302-21 for Rendezvousing at this place there came in 
302-22 ten Officers with twenty men only. If I had 
302-23 any other than paper money and you appro - 
302-24 ved of it; I would send to Pennsylvania 
302-25 and the Borders of Carolinas: I am confident 
302-26 men might be had there. Your Honor 
302-27 never having given any particular Directi - 
302-28 ons about the Provisions; I should be glad to 
302-29 know whether you would have more laid in 
302-30 than what will serve for twelve hundred men; 
302-31 that I may give orders accordingly. 
302-32 As I can not now conceive that 
302-33 any great danger can be apprehended at 
302-34 Fort Cumberland this Winter; I am sensible 
302-35 that my constant attendance there can not 
303-02 Letters Orders and Instructions December. 1755. 
303-04 be so serviceable as riding from place making the 
303-05 proper Dispositions and seeing that all our necef - 
303-06 saries are forwarded up with dispatch. I there - 
303-07 fore think it advisable to inform your Honour 
303-08 of it hoping that it will correspond with your own opinion. 
303-09 I forgot to mention when I was down that Mr. Living - 
303-10 ston the Fort  - Major was appointed adjutant to our 
303-11 Regiments:  - I knew of none else whose long servitude 
303-12 in a military way had qualified better for the office 
303-13 he was appointed the 17th. of September. 
303-14 Captain Mercer's pay as aid de camp 
303-15 seems yet doubtful; I should be glad if your Honour 
303-16 would fix its: so is Captain Stewartss: If Captain Stew - 
303-17 arts is encreased I suppose all the Officers belonging 
303-18 to the Light Horse will expect to have theirs augmen - 
303-19 ted also. Colonel Stephens in a late letter dis - 
303-20 covered an inclination to go to the Creek and Che - 
303-21 rokee Indians this Winter. I told him where to ap - 
303-22 ply if he had any such thoughts. I believe on 
303-23 so useful a Businefs he might be spared until 
303-24 the Spring. If your Honor think proper to or - 
303-25 der the Act of Afsembly for apprehending Deser - 
303-26 ters and against harbouring them to be published 
303-27 every Sunday in each parish Church until the 
303-28 people were made acquainted with the Law it would 
303-29 have a very good effect. The Commonalty in gene - 
303-30 ral or more through ignorance than designs: few 
303-31 of them are acquainted that such a Law existss: and 
303-32 there is no other certain way of bringing it to their 
303-33 knowledge. There are a great many of the men 
303-34 that did once belong to our Companies deserted 
303-35 from the Regiments into which they were draugh - 
303-36 ted that would now gladly return if they could 
304-01 304. Letters Orders and Instructions. December 1755. 
304-03 be sure of idemnity. If your Honor would 
304-04 be kind enough to intimate this to General 
304-05 Shirley or the Colonels of those Regiments  - it 
304-06 would be of service to uss: without leave we 
304-07 dare not receive them. etc.

304-11 5th. To John Robinson Esquire Speaker. 
304-12 The Bearer captain John Mercer 
304-13 having leave to go down and Settle his ac - 
304-14 compts with the Committee; is ordered to 
304-15 call upon you for the balance of the ten 
304-16 thousand pounds which I believe we shall 
304-17 want before another opportunity may offer; 
304-18 this being the time when our Demands for 
304-19 money are greatest. When I left Willi - 
304-20 amsburgh I intended to proceed to Winches - 
304-21 ter; but meeting with Letters at Fredericks - 
304-22 burgh informing me that peace prevailed 
304-23 above and that nothing was immediate - 
304-24 ly wanted but Salt; I came up here to en - 
304-25 gage what I could and to wait the arrival 
304-26 of some Recruits at this place; and a Vefsel 
304-27 with sundry arms etc. for the Troops. This Vef - 
304-28 sel left Williamsburgh two days after I did 
304-29 and is not yet arriveds: neither is the Ex - 
304-30 prefs returned which the Governor sent to 
304-31 General Shirley for Commifsions for the 
304-32 Field Officers of our Regiments: which gives 
304-33 me much concern; fearing that this de - 
304-34 lay is ominous. In that case I shall not 
304-35 know how to act;  - it will be uselefs for me

305-05 and directed by another who can have no 
305-06 other pretence than that of having a commif - 
305-07 sion from the King. 
305-08 We shall suffer very greatly in a little 
305-09 time for want of Clothing for the Soldiers; and none 
305-10 can be had here nor in short I believe in the 
305-11 Country. Those which Carlyle and Dalton con - 
305-12 tracted to furnish we are disappointed in; and 
305-13 they say they have searched all the Stores in 
305-14 Maryland as well as this part of Virginia and 
305-15 none are able to furnish Clothes. We have 
305-16 sustained inconceivable lofses by the commif - 
305-17 saries delayss: many of the Carolina Beeves 
305-18 are dead through poverty and bad manage - 
305-19 ment; and the chief of them are too poor to 
305-20 slaughter. Pray make my Compliments 
305-21 to my Friends below; and believe me etc.
